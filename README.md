# Asciiartist
an image-textart converter written in python, also the test recipient of some code obfuscation/compression practicing.
i originally wrote this i think a few months after i wrote the etch a sketch.

uses python and the tkinter gui library.

you should be able to run it with a python (â‰¤3.6) interpreter in any directory, though when you use the 'save' option it will attempt to save in "~/Downloads/".
the command to run it should be `python3 <path/to/asciicode.py>`.

some images might make it catch a loop, but it only happened with a high res image when i tested it.
