This is just an ascii art converter made with python, 

if on mac you may have to confirm that this isnt a virus by doing:
system preferences > security & privacy > general
the option to open file should be there after it was denied

if ur on windows/linux, the startup is a bit more glitchy; it should open initially, but u will
probably get a confirmation in the command prompt wether you trust the source or not, confirming
in that should activate the progam successfully.
